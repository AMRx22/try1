            <p>a. Note risk factors. age, Medi stress.</p>
            <p>b. Observe for signs and symptoms of BP alterations headach, Nausca.</p>
            <p>c. Determine client's age.</p>
            <p>.2 *Assess for factors that normally influence BP: (Age, Sex, Medications, Daily (diurnal) variation, Exercise, Smoking, Stress, Race, Medical condition, Obesity & Temperature) </p>
            <p>.3 Determine best site for BP assessment. </p>
            <p>4. Determine previous baseline BP (if available)</p>
            <p> 5. Encourage client to avoid exercise and smoking for 30 minutes before assessment.</p>
            <p>6. Arranged and checked the necessary equipment.</p>
            <p>7. Positioned client. </p>
            <p>8. Explained procedure to client and have client rested for 5 minutes before measurement. a. Palpation Method</p>
            <p>9 *Washed Hands </p>
            <p>10. Exposed upper arm fully by removing constricting clothing </p>
            <p>11. Palpated brachial artery. Positioned cuff 2.5 cm (1 inch) above site of brachial pulsation (antecubital space). • Centered bladder of cuff above artery. Wrapped cuff evenly and snugly around upper arm.</p>
            <p>12. Checked the manometer is on vertical position at eve level.</p>
            <p>13. *Palpated brachial or radial artery with fingertips of one hand while inflating cuff rapidly to pressure 30mmg above point at which pulse disappears </p>
            <p>14. Deflated cuff rapidly and completely </p>
            <p>15. Waited one to two minutes before inflating the cuff for the auscultatory method b. Auscultation Method </p>
            <p>16. Repeated the steps 1-5 of palpation method.</p>
            <p>17. Deflated cuff fully and wait 30 seconds.</p>
            <p>18. Placed stethoscope earpieces in ears and be sure sounds are clear, not muffled. (Checked whether stethoscope is functioning)</p>
            <p>19. Relocated brachial artery and place bell or diaphragm chest piece over it.</p>
            <p>20. Closed valve of pressure bulb </p>
            <p> 21. Inflated cuff to 30mm Hg above palpated × 30 systolic pressure</p>
            <p>22. Slowly released valve and allow mercury to fall at rate of 2 to 3mm Hg/sec.</p>
            <p>23. *Noted point on manometer when first clear sound is heard </p>
            <p>24. *Continued to deflate cuff gradually, noting point on manometer at which sound disappears in adults.</p>
            <p> 25. Deflated cuff rapidly and completely. Removed from client's arm.</p>
            <p>26. Repeated procedure on other arm after 2 minutes. (If indicated)</p>

            <p>EVALUATION </p>
            <br>
            <p> 31. Waited 1 to 2 minutes and repeat assessment. (if inaudible) </p>
            <p>32. Tried alternative methods if still inaudible.</p>
            <p>33. Compared BP reading with previous baseline. RECORDING AND REPORTING</p>
            <p>34. Recorded BP in medical record or flow sheet.</p>
            <p>35. Reported abnormal findings to nurse-in- charge or physician.</p>
